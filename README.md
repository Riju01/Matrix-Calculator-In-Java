# Matrix-Calculator-In-Java

This Java program performs basic matrix operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It prompts the user to enter two matrices and offers several operations based on the matrix dimensions. The program includes input validation and clear error messages to guide the user in performing each operation.


Features:

Matrix Input: Users can input dimensions and elements for two matrices.
Addition: If the two matrices have the same dimensions, it calculates the element-wise sum.
Subtraction: Offers a choice to subtract either the first matrix from the second or vice versa. The matrices must have the same dimensions for subtraction.
Multiplication: Multiplies the matrices if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.
User Prompts: Detailed prompts and error handling guide users through the matrix setup and operations.


Usage:

Compile and run the program.
Input the dimensions and elements for the matrices as prompted.
Choose the operation you'd like to perform (addition, subtraction order, or multiplication).
View the result of the operation printed in matrix form.
This project provides a simple introduction to working with matrices in Java and demonstrates control structures, array manipulation, and user interaction.
